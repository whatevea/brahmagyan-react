                <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">The physical structure of the body, including the gross body, is the external covering of the soul, perceptible through senses like sight, touch, measurement, and feeling. It serves as the medium for the intellect and mind to interact with the world. The subtle and physical manifestations of every event in the intellect and mind can be explored through the body, revealing the state of the mind and intellect based on physical changes and sensations.</p>

                    <li>Healthy Gross Body: Perfect balance of consciousness in eyes, nose, ears, tongue, and skin.</li>
                    <li>Semi-Healthy Gross Body: Imbalance of consciousness in eyes, nose, ears, tongue, and skin.</li>
                    <li>Unhealthy Gross Body: Complete imbalance of consciousness in eyes, nose, ears, tongue, and skin.</li>

                <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">Intelligence forms through the intricate network of subtle fibers and organs within the gross body, discernible and tactile yet its qualities are only felt by the mind. Intelligence produces discernment, aiding in the proper understanding of subjects, and is present in every subtle cell, fiber, and organ, manifesting as imaginative and creative intelligence in different hemispheres of the brain.</p>
